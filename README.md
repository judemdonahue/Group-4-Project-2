## Description
The Social Task Managing app is designed to leverage the power of social accountability to motivate individuals to complete their daily tasks.

The motivation behind this app was to provide a solution for individuals who struggle with procrastination or lack motivation to complete their daily tasks and goals. By incorporating social accountability, the app aims to create a sense of urgency and motivation by allowing others to see an individual's progress.

The project was built with the intention of addressing the common problem of task management and productivity. Many people find it challenging to stay motivated and committed to their tasks, especially when there are no external consequences for not completing them. By integrating social elements into the task management process, the app aims to provide users with a supportive community that can hold them accountable and increase their chances of maintaining productivity.

The app solves the problem of low motivation and procrastination by introducing social pressure as a motivator. It provides users with a platform where they can share their daily tasks and goals with others who can see their progress. Knowing that others can see their achievements or lack thereof creates a sense of responsibility and accountability, thus encouraging users to complete their tasks on time.

During the development of the Social Task Managing app, several valuable lessons were learned. Firstly, the power of social accountability was reaffirmed as an effective motivator for individuals. The app demonstrated that the fear of public exposure and the desire to avoid the shame of not completing tasks can be strong motivational factors.
